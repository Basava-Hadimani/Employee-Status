# Employee-Status
This project is used to get the updates of employees in an organisation


Its a project given as an assignment to me in Aricent technologies during my training.

Employees in an organisation can register to the company. Once they are registered using their name, employee id and password, employee can login to his account using name and password.

Once the employee loged in to account, he/she can update his daily task, status of the task and the hours spent on the project.

all the details of the employee is stored in MySQL database.
